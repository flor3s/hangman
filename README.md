# Welcome to Hangman!

This project creates a game of hangman in your terminal, complete with file save/load functionality using JSON serialization. The main aim of this project was to gain an understanding of files and serialization in Ruby. It also provided practice working with class objects and methods.

## TO PLAY: 
Clone into this project, navigate to the directory and run `ruby hangman.rb` in your console. 
Enjoy!

## Potential Updates
* Add a `replay?` method that either exits the game or starts a new game after the initial game ends.
* Multiplayer? AI?
